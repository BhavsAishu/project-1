GitÂ is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and is used to help coordinate work among several people on a project while tracking progress over time. 
Git favors both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files. It enables multiple users to work together and handles large projects efficiently.
A version control system (VCS) records all the changes made to a file or set of data, so a specific version may be called later if needed.
